## HAC + HER
This implementation uses a ddpg agent like the original HER one from OpenAI for the lowest layer and actor and critic implementations similar to the original HAC ones for all layers above.

# Hyperparameters and runs
A list of hyperparameters is given in the initialize_HAC.py file. The file will start runs with all possible hparam combinations and log the results to tensorboard.
