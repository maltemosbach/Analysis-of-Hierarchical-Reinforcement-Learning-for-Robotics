# Fetch environments
This directory contains the implementation to solve the FetchReach-v1, FetchPush-v1 and FetchPickAndPlace-v1 environments from the OpenAI Gym robotics envs suite. This should enable comparative evaluation of a classical (non-hierarchical) RL algoriothm with a two layered hierarchical architecture.

The conda environment used to obtain all results can be found in fetch_environments.yml in this directory.
